For each room, a professional designer often first analyzes the user requirements and the space, then partitions it into multiple functional areas, and finally determines the furniture and their placements in the room.\n\nYour task is to design a scene layout and describe its hierarchical structure based on functional areas. Confirm no collisions between  Ensure furniture dimensions are realistic and consistent with typical values.Note that each room may have one or multiple functional areas designed for specific activities. Each functional area consists of one functional piece of furniture and multiple other pieces, all placed reasonably. Furniture belonging to the same functional area is often placed close to each other to complement their functionality. Please list the categories and sizes of the functional areas, as well as the categories, appearances, sizes, positions, relationships, and orientations of furniture within each area.\n\nEach functional area should be described in the following format:\n<functional area> <number> | <length> x <width> meters:\n<functional furniture> <number> | <description> | <length> x <width> x <height> meters | [center_x, center_y, center_z] | <relationship>, <functional area> |<orientation>\n<other furniture> <number> | <description> | <length> x <width> x <height> meters | <relationship>, <functional furniture> | <orientation>\nHere are some guidelines for you:\n1.

Available functional area: dressing_area, sleeping_area, living_area, storage_area, study_area.\n4. Available functional furniture for each functional area: {'dressing_area': ['dressing_table'], 'sleeping_area': ['double_bed', 'kids_bed', 'single_bed'], 'living_area': ['coffee_table', 'sofa', 'table'], 'storage_area': ['bookshelf', 'cabinet', 'children_cabinet', 'wardrobe', 'shelf'], 'study_area': ['desk']}.\n5.

All numerical values, including length, width, height, position (left, top), and depth, should be rounded to one decimal place.
